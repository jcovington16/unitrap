# TableState

On-chain table state using Chainlink's [Any API](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/advanced-tutorial/) and [Arbitrum](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/getting-started-devs).

# Background

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to query off-chain Tableland table state and get data back on-chain. It leverages Chainlink's Oracle network to fulfill on-chain requests at the Tableland gateway and write the data back to the smart contract, allowing for on-chain reads to take place. Arbitrum's Goerli testnet is also used to demonstrate how to use Chainlink in a testnet environment.

This example hard codes the Chainlink Oracle and contract info for the Arbtrum Goerli network. Note this is a ["single word"](https://docs.chain.link/any-api/get-request/examples/single-word-response/) response of a `uint256`, but others are possible (see [Any API docs](https://docs.chain.link/any-api/introduction)). The Oracle used here is [Translucent](https://translucent.link/products/get-uint256/). This is unique since the the Chainlink documentation [does not list Arbitrum Goerli](https://docs.chain.link/any-api/testnet-oracles/) as a network with Chainlink-moderated contracts, so using this setup allows developers to access potentially new testnet deployment grounds on the Arbitrum Goerli network.

For a full walkthrough, see the documentation [here](https://docs.tableland.xyz/on-chain-reads-with-chainlink-arbitrum).

## Project Structure

The final output of this project produces the following:

- `tasks` => Holds a number of useful tasks, including requesting and reading off-chain table data.
- `scripts` => Deploy and/or verify the `TableState` contract.

# Usage

## Setup

Before getting started, be sure to update the values in a `.env` file as well as sign up for an [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/) and [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/myapikey) account:

```
# Account private key
ABRITRUM_GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY=fixme
# Alchemy API key
ABRITRUM_GOERLI_API_KEY=fixme
# Arbiscan API key (contract verification)
ABRISCAN_API_KEY=fixme
```

## Deployment

Deploy the contract, where the `url` and `path` are set within the `deploy` script and also available as tasks, if needed:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network arbitrum-goerli
```

Upon deploying, save the value of the contract in `hardhat.configs.ts`,

under the `config` variable's `config` key.

Below is an example of what this should look like.

The reference to Translucent is the node operator;

Chainlink also has a series of hosted nodes that can be used for testing purposes
(except, they don't have an Aribtrum Goerli option :/).

Keep in mind that each node may implement data transformation parameters slightly differently
(e.g., `req.addInt("multiply", ...)` vs. `req.addInt("times", ...)`).

```javascript
...
config: {
  args: {
    contractAddress: "0x1C3a02fC79b8C0C220fECf6D6409dF514097D70c ", // IMPORTANT: Update with deployed contract
    linkTokenAddress: "0xd14838A68E8AFBAdE5efb411d5871ea0011AFd28", // Arbitrum Goerli LINK token
    oracleAddress: "0x2362A262148518Ce69600Cc5a6032aC8391233f5", // Translucent (node operator) address
    jobId: "7599d3c8f31e4ce78ad2b790cbcfc673" // Translucent job ID for single word uint256 request
  }
}
...
```

Optionally, verify the contract:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/verify.ts --network arbitrum-goerli
```

## Tasks

A number of tasks are included.
Some simply read on-chain data, and others cause state to be overwritten.
All tasks can be listed with the command `npx hardhat`.

Make a request to the Tableland gateway for the Chainlink Oracle to fulfill:

```
npx hardhat request-data --network arbitrum-goerli
```

Read the associated response that's written back on-chain:

```
npx hardhat read-data --network arbitrum-goerli
```

Try running some of the other tasks:

```
Fund the contract with 1 LINK:
npx hardhat fund-link --network arbitrum-goerli

Set the request URL:
npx hardhat set-url --url <value> --network arbitrum-goerli

Get the request URL:
npx hardhat read-url --network arbitrum-goerli

Set the request path:
npx hardhat set-path --path <value> --network arbitrum-goerli

Get the request path:
npx hardhat read-path --network arbitrum-goerli

Set the LINK default fee amount:
npx hardhat set-fee --fee <value> --network arbitrum-goerli

Set the LINK token address:
npx hardhat set-link --address <value> --network arbitrum-goerli

Withdraw LINK:
npx hardhat withdraw --network arbitrum-goerli
```

# Output

The following `TableState` contract was deployed on Arbitrum Goerli:

- Contract: [0x1C3a02fC79b8C0C220fECf6D6409dF514097D70c](https://goerli.arbiscan.io/address/0x1C3a02fC79b8C0C220fECf6D6409dF514097D70c)

It makes a request to the Tableland testnets gateway for the data at `healthbot_421613_1`:

- Request URL: https://testnets.tableland.network/api/v1/query?statement=select%20*%20from%20healthbot_421613_1
- Request path: `"counter"`
- Example response:

```json
{
  "counter": 68974
}
```
